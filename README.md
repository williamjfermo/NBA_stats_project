# NBA Statistical Analysis Project
This project is a part of the [Flatiron](http://https://flatironschool.com/) for Data Science
#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to use Statistical Analysis on NBA data to help teams win an NBA championship    

### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics
* Parised Sample T-Test 
* Bayesian Statistics
* Data Visualization


### Technologies
* Python
* Tableau
* Webscraping, BeautifulSoup
* Pandas, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn, 
* Jupyter


## Project Description
Use of statistical analysis on NBA data to help teams win an NBA championship.  First we found a reliable source for our NBA data.  WE found Basketball Reference had all the data we would need to make our analysis.   We used BeautifulSoup to scrape the relevant data needed for the project.  Tested home wins vs road wins.  Compared west vs east conference payrolls.  Compared Talent Distribution west vs east conference.  Found top indicators what made a team playoff worthy.   Used overall 1980 to 2019 data set to compare and a 2013 to 2019 to find current trends.   Used Naive Bayes to determine findings.  

## Needs of this project

- find a source of data for NBA stats
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- findings
- writeup/reporting

## Getting Started

1. Webscraped data from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/)) and imported to csv files.
2. Csv data is being kept [here](https://github.com/williamjfermo/NBA_stats_project.git) within this repo.   
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](https://github.com/williamjfermo/NBA_stats_project.git)

## Analysis
* Home Court Advantage plays a roll in wins
* Payroll is Balanced
* Talent is Everywhere
* Small Ball

## Future Improvements

- Use better models and algorithms to better identify winning teams.
- All stats are heavily offensive and doesn't capture the intangibles such as game momentum which are reliant on good defense.
- Feature engineer more defensive parameters
- Expand analysis specifically on playoff series to identify key parameters for wins during playoffs
